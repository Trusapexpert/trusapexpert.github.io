# Trusap Expert — Training Institute Website

This repository contains a simple static website for Trusap Expert training institute suitable for GitHub Pages. It includes:

- `index.html` — single-page layout with About, Courses and Contact sections
- `css/styles.css` — basic responsive styles
- `js/main.js` — lightweight contact form handler (mailto fallback)

How to customize:
- Edit `index.html` to change text, add courses or sections.
- Replace contact email in `index.html` and `js/main.js`.
- Add images to an `assets/` folder and reference them from HTML.

To publish: ensure GitHub Pages is enabled on the `main` branch (or change branch in repository settings). See steps below.

Optional:
- Add a `CNAME` file with your domain if you have one.
- Integrate a form backend (Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a small server) if you want real form submissions.
